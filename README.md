# Ebay Listings Analytics

The main idea of this project was creating a web application which lets you query for listings across several Ebay markets and afterwards analyzing the retrieved results. For example, you may search for "Iphone 16 Pro" and retrieve listings from Ebay US, Ebay Germany, Ebay Spain at once, with information on minimum and maximum price, average and median price for the retrieved items in each selected market. With this application you can browse for items and compare prices across several Ebay markets faster and easier.
